## Credits

Without a few people, this project would be much much harder.  In no particular order:

* penguinwizzard for figuring out how to write maps
* tet, Sir_Kane, and hex6 for finding the strings for most of the flags and enums
* Quintinity for some incredibly helpful commits
* OrangeSodaSmurf for providing a coupon for a free domain name



## Compiling the Source

All major dependencies are included in the repository.  They are 
* [KVLib] - Valve Key-Value parsing library in C#

Worldsmith was created with Visual Studio 2013.

If you change any of the data schemas, be sure to run the ClassGen build target.  This will update the data class definitions.
